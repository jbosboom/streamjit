 * reading for incoming {@link MessageElement} from the corresponding
 * {@link StreamNode} and process it.
 * <li>Non-blocking IO using java NIO package. In this case,
 * {@link CommunicationManager} should handle the dispatcher thread pool which
 * may select ready channels and process the send/receive operation.

 * TODO: Need to handle the connection loss and reconnection. Assigns nodeID
 * based on the connecting order.
